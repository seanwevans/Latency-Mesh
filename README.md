# 🕸️ LatencyMesh (`lm`)

**LatencyMesh** continuously performs asynchronous traceroutes to map the topology of your surrounding Internet in real time.  
It constructs a **weighted mesh** where each edge corresponds to a hop and its latency.  
Over time, it reveals the structure of your network neighborhood.
